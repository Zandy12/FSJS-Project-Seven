This is the seventh project of the www.teamtreehouse.com Full Stack JavaScript techdegree utilizing React.js. The project uses the Flickr API and pulls JSON data via the Fetch API to generate images with a search tag that is custom generated through the user's search input. In this project, I learned about JSX markup and React.js features such as components, props, state, passing data/parameters, and importing/exporting for creating a fully dynamic single-page-app web page.
